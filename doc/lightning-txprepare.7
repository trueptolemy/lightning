.SH NAME


lightning-txprepare - Command to prepare to withdraw funds from the
internal wallet\.

.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBtxprepare\fR \fIoutputs\fR [\fIfeerate\fR] [\fIminconf\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fBtxprepare\fR RPC command creates an unsigned transaction which
spends funds from c-lightningâ€™s internal wallet to the outputs specified
in \fIoutputs\fR\.

The \fIoutputs\fR is the array of outputs that must specify \fIdestination\fR
and \fIamount\fR\. Its format is like:
[{\fIdestination\fR: address1, \fIamount\fR: amount1},
{\fIdestination\fR: address2, \fIamount\fR: amount2}, \.\.\.],
or
[{\fIdestination\fR: address, \fIamount\fR: \fIall\fR}]\.
It supports the any number of outputs\.

\fIdestination\fR is the address which can be of any Bitcoin accepted type,
including bech32\.

\fIamount\fR is the amount to be withdrawn from the internal wallet (expressed,
as name suggests, in amount)\. The string \fIall\fR can be used to specify
withdrawal of all available funds\. Otherwise, it is in amount precision; it
can be a whole number, a whole number ending in \fIsat\fR, a whole number ending
in \fI000msat\fR, or a number with 1 to 8 decimal places ending in \fIbtc\fR\.

\fBtxprepare\fR is similar to the first part of a \fBwithdraw\fR command, but
supports multiple outputs and uses \fIoutputs\fR as parameter\. The second part
is provided by \fBtxsend\fR\.

.SH RETURN VALUE

On success, an object with attributes \fIunsigned_tx\fR and \fItxid\fR will be
returned\. You need to hand \fItxid\fR to \fBtxsend\fR or \fBtxdiscard\fR, as the
inputs of this transaction are reserved until then, or until the daemon
restarts\.


\fIunsigned_tx\fR represents the raw bitcoin transaction (not yet signed)
and \fItxid\fR represent the bitcoin transaction id\.


On failure, an error is reported and the transaction is not created\.


The following error codes may occur:

.RS
.IP \[bu]
-1: Catchall nonspecific error\.
.IP \[bu]
301: There are not enough funds in the internal wallet (including
fees) to create the transaction\.
.IP \[bu]
302: The dust limit is not met\.
